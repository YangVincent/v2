## Background
A good friend of mine is a germaphobe. From my point of view, she really does the most when it comes to keeping clean. Her car is spotless and has covers that have their own covers in turn. 
She cleans her phone with wipes every day, washes her hands frequently, adds napkins to the table on which she puts her phone, etc.

We thought it'd be fun to do an experiment. How much bacteria is there actually, on someone's phone? How about after a day's use of a phone that's cleaned nightly? How about
right after cleaning?

## Preliminary Research
Agar is a gelatinous substance useful for growing bacteria. It's a culture that provides nutrients but is indigestible to micro-organism. Some types of agar are MacConkey, Chocolate,
Tryptic Soy, Hektoan, and Mannitol. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

### Making Agar
#### Ingredients
* Teaspoon of beef stock powder
* Cup of water
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon gelatin
* Saucepan for boiling mixture
* 2 x Petri dishes
* Spoon
* Sticky Tape
* Felt-tip pen to label
* Cotton swab (optional)
* 35-37 C incubator oven (somewhere hot)

#### Instructions
* Pour water to saucepan; boil
* Add beef stock powder, sugar, gelatin to boiling water. Stir until consistent.
* Cool agar mixture for 10 minutes. Let it stay hot to avoid gelatin settling and to prevent contamination. The air isn't sterile, but try your best.
* Take the lid off the petri dishes and half-fill it with agar. 
* Put the lid back on, and put it in the fridge for 4 hours. Don't touch the agar.
* Swab and put onto petri dishes.
* Label, return in 3-5 days. Don't open the dishes.
