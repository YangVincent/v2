Caring about ergonomics is probably one of the most beneficial things you can do if you're often on the computer. Even in high school, several people I knew developed carpal tunnel before they'd even turned 18. Hours of gaming and staring at screens leaves many with hunched backs, wrist pains, and an inability to perform. There are four main components that drastically changed my productivity and improved my comfort while coding.

## Kinesis Advantage

There are two types of keyboards - mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards. Membrane keyboards are extremely popular due to their low cost and simple manufacturing. In fact, most laptops have membrane keyboards. Technically speaking, these keyboards by detecting which locations are pressed down, and sending corresponding keyboard inputs to the computer. This also means that there exists an extremely low number of keys that can be pressed at a time while having all inputs register in the computer. This is called n-key rollover. On the other hand, mechanical keyboards work 
by having a separate switch for every single key. This results in many more keys being registered at once, often reaching up to 12+ at a time (better for gaming). Switches also last much longer than membranes, often allowing users to reach around 50 million presses, while membrane keyboards allow around 1 million key presses. Switches are better ergonomically, because they allow you to use minimal energy to register each key press instead of 'bottoming out', which is when someone presses the key all the way down in order to register a click.

The Kinesis Advantage has two other significant advantages. It is created with two wells - one for each hand such that each is in a natural position. The keys are set up in columns so each key is exactly where you would expect it to be naturally. This serves to minimize the amount of strain needed when typing. The distance between wells is also approximately that of shoulder width so the user isn't forced to push their arms together, thus rotating their arms. Finally,
the keyboard has extra keys for the thumb in order to better optimize how we use each finger. For example, my left thumb's key is currently mapped to backspace, along with control, alt, and more.
