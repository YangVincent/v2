## What is Code Search?
Now that I'm done with school, I've often found myself thinking of how many positive impacts unique opportunities and people at Davis have had on me.

In all honesty, at the end of my first year at Davis, my typical day consisted of waking up at 1PM, 
eating some Party Pizza Tostitos, and playing games/watching movies until 6AM (sprinkled with occasional
assignments)... rinse and repeat. I'd done nothing, learned little, and thrown a year away. 

I thought to myself -- if I graduated like this, I'd never be able to forgive myself. 

Now although I haven't actually attended multiple universities, I imagine some of the experiences I have now
wouldn't have been possible elsewhere.

## Why Code Search is Important and useful
the same concept in a wide variety of ways to accomodate for everyone.

## Why Schools Should Teach Code Search
Research significantly changed my time at Davis. I was able to work on extremely interesting projects and narrow
in on my interests while playing around with various sub-fields of CS. Over the years, I co-created a visualization
method for dealing with large datasets with continuous variables, developed a tool to help Smart Contract developers
test their Solidity contracts, researched network anonymization flaws in today's industry, defended against 
heap memory attacks by randomizing malloc's header space, and created assignments for Davis's Computer Security
class.

Research allows you to work on interesting projects with a domain expert while exposing you to the edge of a field.
It is (hopefully) a perfect intersection of academics and application. Professors at Davis were readily
willing to advise me and connect me to others to further my development.

## Petitions
Petitions at Davis allow you to petition for anything. Keep in mind these have to be approved, but
they helped me immensely. Over the years, petitions helped me:
  * Substitute Biology for Chemistry
  * Complete my M.S. in 2 quarters. The required minimum residency is 3. 
  * Teach and research for units

## Notable Mentions
My time at Davis was substantially enhanced by the following people. I would be incredibly different today had I not met them.
  * Rylan Schaeffer
  * Prof. Matloff
  * Prof. Bishop
  * Davey Jay Belliss
  * Annie Tu
  * Vincent Yeh
  * Vishesh Mani, Howard Tan
