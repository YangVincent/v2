Since October 17, 2019, (my visit to Boston for Rylan with Jessica), I've been tracking my time. I've split it into several categories:
* Social (time spent with others)
* Sleep
* Work
* Chilling (misc. relaxation)
* Driving
* Personal (personal goals)
* Gym
* Appointment

Especially in that time frame, I was optimizing for hanging out with others to the point that I would neglect/optimize my chores (such as
my laundry system which is a story for another day). Admittedly, this was helped by the fact that I had significant trips during the holiday season.
One other fact that I was/am a little proud of, but I ended up hanging out in some form every day last year.

Thus far, in total I've:

|Category   |Total Time |Percentage |
|--------------|--------|-----|
|Social        |1705:37 |56%  |
|Sleep         |631:10  |21%  |
|Work          |278:55  |9%   |
|Chilling      |170:58  |6%   |
|Driving       |60:33   |2%   |
|Personal Work |58:58   |2%   |
|Gym           |42:33   |1%   |
|Appointment   |36:51   |1%   |

My behavior is also quite different from weekends and weekdays.

## Weekend Average

|Category   |Total Time |Percentage |
|--------------|--------|-----|
|Social        |20:09|70%  |
|Sleep         |05:46|20%  |
|Work          |:02|0%   |
|Chilling      |1:07|4%   |
|Driving       |:11|1%   |
|Personal Work |:19|1%   |
|Gym           |:20|1%   |
|Appointment   |:32|2%   |

## Weekday Average

|Category   |Total Time |Percentage |
|--------------|--------|-----|
|Social        |14:40|50%  |
|Sleep         |06:07|21%  |
|Work          |03:42|13%  |
|Chilling      |1:50|6%  |
|Driving       |:44|3%  |
|Personal Work |:40|2%  |
|Gym           |:26|1%  |
|Appointment   |:07|1%  |

# Overlapping
Since I view these goals as optimizing pillars, I want to overlap as many things as possible to get the most out of any unit time. For instance, 
working on productive things while being social is better than any single option on its own. As such, you can notice that the times should
add up to more than the time alotted. In 15 weeks, there are 2520 hours, but the sum here is 2980.
