## Overview
In modern times, we have learned so much about fields that it is difficult, if not impossible for a single person
to have sufficient simultaneous depth and breadth across a conventional field. As such, we must further subdivide
to allow more specific specializations. Checklists are a proven, successful way to coordinate between these various
subfields.

## Inspiration for Checklists
Checklists are used in aviation and construction -- two fields where immense detail and coordination is required.

## Using Checklists to Battle Complexity
Two checklists are used in construction: One for a list of necessary steps to be completed, and another for
important communication/sync-ups to occur. This allows us to leverage individual skill sets. 

Checklists should be short (<1 or 2 minutes to complete), with as few items as possible. There are two types:
read-do, and do-verify.

## Team Efforts
People work better in teams when there is no power dynamic. Power dynamics are greatly diminished when everyone
knows everyone else's names.

## On Medicine
Hospitals can greatly improve their efficiency and survival/treatment rates by implementing suggested checklists,
although there is a strong aversion to them in general.
