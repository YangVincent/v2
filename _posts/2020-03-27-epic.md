# Overview
The Epic Pass has 3 resorts at Tahoe -- Northstar, Heavenly, and Kirkwood. I think it beats out the Ikon (Squaw + Alpine) for anyone in the bay area; here's why.

Although Ikon has the single best resort (Squaw), every type of riding you might possibly want can be found in some improved form at one of the 3 resorts.

# Epic
[Longest run](https://www.onthesnow.com/lake-tahoe/statistics.html): Heavenly, 5.5mi.
Best Terrain Park: Northstar
Best Trees: Northstar
Best Beginner Areas: Northstar (+ fantastic village if they give up)
Best Terrain, Steeps & Powder: Kirkwood, due to higher elevation. It's one of the highest snowfall areas in North America, including Canada. This is Vail's way of appealing to more skilled people.

# Ikon
Squaw has equal beginner areas (+ village), steeps, and powder.
