## Background
I've recently started looking into hanggliding. It's more appealing to me than paragliding cause there's fewer parts (and probably easier setup).

There's several gyms near me: East Bay, Pacifica, Mission Peak, Milpitas. 

The death rate is around 1 death per 1,000 active pilots per year. A full set of gear costs around 4k. People can get in the air and go straight after
the first lesson. There are several levels. 

In progress.
