# Welcome!

I'm a Software Engineer at [Google](https://security.googleblog.com/) who enjoys
[snowboarding](https://www.yangvincent.com/snowboarding), playing [badminton](https://www.yangvincent.com/badminton), [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/1211576758), and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/vincentyang).

I'm fascinated by our raisons d'Ãªtre and how we may best fulfill them.
